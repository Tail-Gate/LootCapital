# Focal Loss Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced CrossEntropyLoss with Focal Loss in the `ClassificationSTGNNTrainer` to better handle class imbalance and hard examples in the STGNN classification model.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Focal Loss Classes

**FocalLoss Class:**
- Standard Focal Loss implementation for handling hard examples
- Parameters: `alpha` (weighting factor), `gamma` (focusing parameter)
- Reduces relative loss for well-classified examples and focuses on hard, misclassified examples

**WeightedFocalLoss Class:**
- Combines class weights with Focal Loss for enhanced imbalance handling
- Incorporates class weights calculated from data distribution
- Provides both focal loss benefits and class weighting

### 2. Focal Loss Implementation

**Key Features:**
- **Hard Example Focus**: Reduces loss for easy examples (high confidence) and increases focus on hard examples
- **Class Weighting**: Combines with class weights for comprehensive imbalance handling
- **Numerical Stability**: Includes epsilon (1e-7) to prevent log(0) errors
- **Flexible Reduction**: Supports 'none', 'mean', and 'sum' reduction methods

**Mathematical Implementation:**
```python
# Apply softmax to get probabilities
probs = torch.softmax(inputs, dim=1)

# Get probability of the correct class
probs = probs.gather(1, targets.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)

# Calculate focal loss
focal_weight = (1 - probs) ** self.gamma
focal_loss = -self.alpha * focal_weight * torch.log(probs + 1e-7)
```

### 3. Trainer Integration

**Updated ClassificationSTGNNTrainer:**
- Added `focal_alpha` and `focal_gamma` parameters to constructor
- Replaced `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` with `WeightedFocalLoss`
- Enhanced logging to display focal loss configuration
- Maintains compatibility with existing training pipeline

**Default Parameters:**
- `focal_alpha = 1.0`: Weighting factor for rare class
- `focal_gamma = 2.0`: Focusing parameter (standard value from research)

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring

**Focal Loss Information:**
- Logs focal loss parameters during trainer initialization
- Displays focal loss configuration in training results
- Saves focal loss parameters in model checkpoints

**Example Output:**
```
Using Weighted Focal Loss with alpha=1.0, gamma=2.0
Class weights: tensor([2.5, 1.0, 2.5])
Loss function: Weighted Focal Loss (alpha=1.0, gamma=2.0)
```

### 5. Walk-Forward Optimization Integration

The walk-forward optimization script automatically benefits from Focal Loss integration since it imports the `ClassificationSTGNNTrainer` from the improved training script.

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Better Handling of Class Imbalance
- **Focal Loss**: Reduces the impact of easy examples and focuses on hard examples
- **Class Weights**: Provides additional weighting for minority classes
- **Combined Approach**: Both mechanisms work together for optimal imbalance handling

### 2. Improved Training Dynamics
- **Hard Example Mining**: Automatically focuses on examples that are difficult to classify
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Less emphasis on easy examples prevents overfitting to majority class
- **Better Convergence**: More stable training with balanced loss contributions

### 3. Enhanced Model Performance
- **Better Minority Class Performance**: Improved precision and recall for underrepresented classes
- **More Robust Predictions**: Better handling of edge cases and difficult examples
- **Balanced Learning**: All classes receive appropriate attention during training

## Parameter Tuning

### Focal Loss Parameters

**Alpha (α):**
- Controls the weight given to rare classes
- Default: 1.0 (balanced)
- Higher values: More emphasis on minority classes
- Lower values: Less emphasis on minority classes

**Gamma (γ):**
- Controls the focusing mechanism
- Default: 2.0 (standard from research)
- Higher values: More aggressive focusing on hard examples
- Lower values: Less aggressive focusing

### Recommended Tuning Strategy

1. **Start with Defaults**: `alpha=1.0, gamma=2.0`
2. **Adjust Alpha**: Based on class imbalance severity
3. **Tune Gamma**: Based on difficulty of examples
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Focus on precision/recall for minority classes

## Testing and Validation

The implementation was thoroughly tested with:
- **Basic Functionality**: Verified Focal Loss produces positive values
- **Weighted Variant**: Confirmed Weighted Focal Loss works with class weights
- **Gradient Flow**: Validated that gradients are computed correctly
- **Comparison**: Compared with CrossEntropyLoss for sanity check
- **Numerical Stability**: Ensured no NaN or Inf values

## Integration with Existing Features

### SMOTE + Focal Loss Synergy
- **SMOTE**: Balances class distribution in training data
- **Focal Loss**: Handles remaining imbalance and hard examples
- **Combined Effect**: Comprehensive approach to class imbalance

### Feature Scaling + Focal Loss
- **Feature Scaling**: Ensures features are on similar scales
- **Focal Loss**: Works optimally with well-scaled features
- **Stable Training**: Both contribute to training stability

## Usage

The Focal Loss integration is automatically applied when using the `ClassificationSTGNNTrainer.train()` method. Parameters can be customized:

```python
trainer = ClassificationSTGNNTrainer(
    config, 
    data_processor, 
    price_threshold=0.018,
    focal_alpha=1.0,  # Customize alpha
    focal_gamma=2.0   # Customize gamma
)
```

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/train_stgnn_improved.py` - Main Focal Loss integration
2. `scripts/walk_forward_optimization.py` - Updated trainer instantiation

## Dependencies

- Existing PyTorch dependencies
- No additional external libraries required
- Compatible with existing training pipeline

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Minority Class Performance**: Improved precision and recall for Down/Up movements
2. **More Robust Model**: Better handling of difficult examples
3. **Reduced Bias**: Less bias toward the majority class (No Direction)
4. **Enhanced Trading Signals**: More accurate predictions for price movements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Parameters**: Automatically tune alpha and gamma based on training dynamics
2. **Loss Monitoring**: Track focal loss components during training
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Include focal loss parameters in hyperparameter search
4. **Advanced Variants**: Implement other focal loss variants (e.g., Label Smoothing Focal Loss)
